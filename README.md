# Student Management System

Welcome to the Student Management System, a simple Java-based command-line application for managing student records.

## Code Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **Main Class**: `StudentManagementSystem.java` is the main class responsible for user interactions and menu options.

- **Student Class**: The `Student` class defines the structure for student data, including fields like ID, name, and mobile number.

- **StudentInsert Class**: The `StudentInsert` class contains methods for inserting, deleting, and displaying student data.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The system provides a straightforward menu-driven interface for ease of use.

- **Data Persistence**: Student data is retained during the program's execution and can be accessed while the application is running.

## Note

Please note that this project is a basic demonstration of a student management system. It does not persist data beyond the current session, meaning that data is lost once the program is closed.

Feel free to explore and enhance the system for more advanced use cases and data persistence requirements.

## Acknowledgments
